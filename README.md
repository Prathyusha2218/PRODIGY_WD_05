#Weather Report App 
-----------------------------------
<p>This project is a simple weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves creating a user interface with HTML, styling it with CSS, and using JavaScript to fetch and display real-time weather data from a weather API based on user input. The app provides an interactive way for users to check the current weather conditions for any city.</p>
